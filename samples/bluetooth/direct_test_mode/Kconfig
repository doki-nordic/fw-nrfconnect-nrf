	help
	  Sets Radio interrupt priority.
	  Levels are from 0 (highest priority) to 6 (lowest priority)

	select EXPERIMENTAL
	help
	  Use USB instead of UART as the DTM interface. For nRF5340 the USB from application core
	  is used as communication interface.

choice DTM_TRANSPORT
	default DTM_TRANSPORT_TWOWIRE
	prompt "Transport layer to use with DTM."
	help
	  Transport interface to use with the DTM.

config DTM_TRANSPORT_TWOWIRE
	bool "DTM over Two Wire UART"
	depends on SERIAL
	help
	  Use the Two Wire transport interface as the DTM transport layer.

config DTM_POWER_CONTROL_AUTOMATIC
	bool "Automatic power control"
	depends on FEM
	default y
	help
	  Set the SoC output power and the front-end module gain to achieve the Tx output power
	  requested by user. If the exact value cannot be achieved, power is set to the closest
	  possible value. If this option is disabled, user can set the SoC output power and the
	  front-end module gain with the separate vendor specific commands.

config DTM_FAST_RAMP_UP
	bool "Enable radio fast ramp up mode"
	default n
	help
	  Do fast ramp up when starting the radio peripheral. This mode will significancy reduce
	  the ramp up time and makes it almost the same on all supported chips.
